# ETL-Pipeline-with-NLP-Demo
## Overview This project demonstrates a simple **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** built in Python.  
It ingests raw CSV data, cleans and transforms it using **Pandas**, and loads the results into a **PostgreSQL database**.  
Additionally, it includes a small **NLP preprocessing demo** using SpaCy to generate text embeddings, showing how unstructured text can be prepared for AI workflows.
## Features
- Data ingestion from CSV files
- Cleaning and transformation with Pandas
- Storage in PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy
- Basic ETL automation with Python scripts
- NLP preprocessing with SpaCy (tokenization, embeddings)
- Example queries for reporting and analysis
- ## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, SQLAlchemy  
- PostgreSQL (with pgvector extension for embeddings)  
- SpaCy for NLP preprocessing  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Run the ETL script:
4. Run the NLP demo:
## Example Use Case
This project simulates how structured and unstructured data can be combined in a pipeline.  
For example, customer feedback (text) can be embedded and stored alongside transactional data in PostgreSQL, enabling richer AI-driven insights.
