# ETL-Pipeline-with-NLP-Demo
This project demonstrates a simple **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** built in Python.   It ingests raw CSV data, cleans and transforms it using **Pandas**, and loads the results into a **PostgreSQL database**.   Additionally, it includes a small **NLP preprocessing demo** using SpaCy to generate text embeddings.
